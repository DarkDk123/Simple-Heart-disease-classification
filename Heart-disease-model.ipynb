    "# **Heart Disease prediction using Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use various python based ML & Data Science libraries in order to build a Machine learning Model capable of predicting whether a patient has heart disease, based on the medical data of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **Supervised machine learning** as the data we've is labelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the following steps to define our workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem definition :** What's the problem, it's type in ML & what we have to get as output.\n",
    "2. **Data :** Look into the data we've, it's source, properties etc.\n",
    "3. **Target (Success) :** What is success for us, what level of results we wanted from our model.\n",
    "4. **Features :** Look into the Features **(predicting variables)**, what's necessary etc.\n",
    "5. **Modelling :** It includes a number of things.\n",
    "    * Get the data ready for the model, Explore and preprocess it.\n",
    "    * Get the best base model for our data & problem, it is generally recursive approach.\n",
    "    * Evaluate our model on various metrics & with different techniques.\n",
    "    * Quantify the model's performance, as results.\n",
    "6. **Experimentation :** The overall Process is very experimental, we've to try different things & determine the best output for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end **ML is all about Experimentation.**\n",
