# **Heart Disease Classification** 


## **Overview**
A very simple Machine Learning model ***(Classification)*** to determine whether a person has **heart-disease** or **not**.

It's a Milestone Project of a [Data Science/ML course](https://github.com/DarkDk123/ZTM-ML-Data-Science) by ZTM.

I'll be using a Small, toy **dataset** here.
